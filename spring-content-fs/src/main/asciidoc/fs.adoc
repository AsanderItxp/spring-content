== Accessing Content

=== Storage Model 

In order to store as much content as possible on the filesystem without hitting limits Spring Content Filesystem supports a hierarchical storage model.  

Content IDs of type `java.util.UUID` are mapped to a nested resource path which has the effect of spreading content over the filesystem. 

Additional storage models and Content ID types can be added by creating  `org.springframework.content.commons.placement.PlacementService` plug-ins.  See <<content-repositories.storage,Storage Model>>.   

=== Setting Content

Storing content is achieved using the `ContentRepostory.setContent(entity, InputStream)` method.  

If content has not yet been stored with this entity before and an ID has not been assigned one will be generated.  

From this ID the `PlacementService` will then be used to determine the physical storage location and the content will be stored.

The @ContentId and @ContentLength annotations will be updated on `entity`.  

If content has been previously stored it will overwritten updating just the @ContentLength attribute, if appropriate.

=== Getting Content

Content can be accessed using the `ContentRepository.getContent(entity)` method.  

=== Unsetting Content

Content can be removed using the `ContentRepository.unsetContent(entity)` method.
